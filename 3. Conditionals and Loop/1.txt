This problem has only one correct answer

Hello
Hi
Hello Hi
Hello Hey



Solution Description
First if condition is true, so "Hello " will be printed. After that, next if condition will be evaluated (as both if's are independent if's) which is again true. Hence, next "Hi " will be printed (obviously in same line). We won't go inside else, as if is already executed.
